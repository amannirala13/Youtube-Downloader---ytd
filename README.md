# How To Use:
___

Download the latest release for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/amannirala13/Youtube-Downloader---ytd/releases).

Run the executable and pass the **YouTube video url**. Once this is done, your video will start downloading.

The output file path is same as the present working directory of your console or the file.

> Note: You can optionally add the path of the executable to environment variable to access the **'ytd'** command from anywhere in the terminal.
